# Contributing to ebx-linkedin-sdk

Contributing code is an essential part of open source and we try to make this as easy as possible. There are several ways you can contribute to ebx-linkedin-sdk.  Here are some guidelines for creating new issues and sending us pull requests. Please read them carefully before contributing.

## How to create a new issue

We like new issues and are very keen to hear your problems, ideas and proposals. After analyzing them, they are categorized and assigned to a milestone. To make this part easier you should give us some information. Please read the checklist and try to mark as many entries as possible.

**Issue checklist:**
* Check the closed issues and don't open duplicates
* Explain your idea or problem in plain English
* Provide a JSON snippet if possible (values may be obfuscated but similar to the original)
* Tell us why this is beneficial and what the advantage is for the users
* Explain your use case, it's easier to understand a proposal if we have some background knowledge

## How to create a pull request

Pull requests (PR) are a very important way to contribute code to the library. We have guidelines for sending us a PR, because changes to the source code are even more fundamental than sending a new issue. This is an overview of our prerequisites. Your PR should fulfill our mandatory prerequisites, but the optionals are big plus and make it much easier to merge a PR in the code. The optional items are written in italic.

**PR checklist:**
* The code must be formatted with our code formatter (have a look at the [CodeStyle folder](https://github.com/ebx/ebx-linkedin-sdk/tree/master/CodeStyle)
* The code should conform to our general design standards (if you feel it's necessary to go against the grain, please ask us first!)
* Existing unit tests have to run without error (we use [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/ebx/ebx-linkedin-sdk))
* The pull request should be mergeable
* Explain why you made the change and why it's beneficial
* Junit tests required for any functional change
* The pull request should be based on the `master` branch
* *Group and squash your commits, fewer are better*

If your issue or your PR doesn't meet a condition, don't be afraid. We are not dogmatic with these rules and you can and should send us your contribution anyway. Be prepared to answer upcoming questions :smirk:
